  * Reduce Build-Depends
    - at-spi2-core was added to fix failing tests. Annotate <!nocheck>.
    - dbus is also used for running tests. Annotate <!nocheck>.
    - Drop docbook-xsl and xsltproc. Documentation is now restructured text.
    - Drop python3-cairo-dbg as Python no longer varies the path for debugged
      extensions.
    - python3-flake8 is used for setup.py quality. Annotate <!nocheck>.
    - locales is evidently used in tests. Annotate <!nocheck>.
    (Closes: #980769)

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Standards-Version: 4.5.1 (no changes required)
  * Make python3-gi Multi-Arch: allowed.
    This allows it to be depended on as "python3-gi:any", in conjunction
    with "python3:any", if an architecture-specific package contains a
    Python script that will "import gi", but does not rely on the Python
    interpreter that runs that script having an architecture that matches
    the architecture of the depending package itself. (Closes: #971745)

    this to the empty package, so that dh_python{3,} doesn't generate the

    matches substrings (e.g. adding kfreebsd-amd64 did also make the amd64
    test-suite non-fatal).
  * Make the test-suite fatal for all architectures so we can more easily
    detect failures.
  * Make the test-suite non-fatal for the the -dbg builds. With python3.4-dbg

    the result for all architectures.

    constructor (such as through GtkBuilder). This works around
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=657403. This patch was reverted

pygobject (2.90.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in: Update Vcs-* for experimental branch.
  * New upstream release:
    - New rewritten invoker is twice as fast and easier to extend and debug
    - Complete break from static bindings so we may improve the core without
      breaking legacy APIs
    - Better type handling
    - Parallel installable with PyGObject 2.28 for legacy binding support
      (2.28 must be compiled with –disable-introspection)
    - Fixed object array handling
    - Added more overrides for PyGTK API emulation
    - Support for function calling using keyword arguments
    - GObject and GLib symbols can now have overrides
    - All static bit removed or made private
    - GVariants now work from callback returns
    - Note that this now enforces a consistent move to the GI bindings. I. e.
      you need to change all "import gobject" statements into "from
      gi.repository import GObject", same for glib.
   * Drop debian/patches/00git_*.patch, all upstream.
   * Drop 20_deprecated_spam.patch, obsolete.
   * debian/control.in: The static bindings (glib, gobject, pygtk, gtk, etc.)
     are deprecated and are now shipped in the separate packages
     python-gobject-2{,-dbg}. Add a dependency to these for the time being to
     not break backwards compatibility. Once all packages have been ported to
     use the GI bindings, this dependency and pygobject-2 will be dropped.
   * debian/control.in: Update package descriptions to point out that this is
     now GI only.
   * debian/control.in, debian/rules: Drop python-gobject-dev package. It's
     not relevant any more for this version, and now built from the
     pygobject-2 source package.
  * debian/rules: Bump shlibs.
  * Drop debian/python-gobject.examples: These are for the old static
    bindings. http://git.gnome.org/browse/pygobject/tree/demos is an actually
    useful and comprehensive example, but not shipped in the release tarballs.
  * debian/rules: Drop obsolete permission fixing, that only applied to the
    examples.

    - 00git_messagebox_type.patch: Fix MessageBox so it correctly handles
      the type constructor param.
    - 00git_python3_build.patch, 00git_python3-maketrans.patch: Python 3 fixes.
    - 00git_gio_test.patch: Port test_properties from static gio to GI Gio, so
      that the tests will also work with Python 3.
  * debian/control.in, debian/rules: Add and build python3-gobject and
    python3-gobject-dbg packages. Until we get py3cairo packaged in Debian (in
    the works), we need to build the python3 flavour with --disable-cairo, and
    apply some workarounds in debian/rules (see the "FIXME"s); these will
    disappear again with py3cairo.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/rules: Move from pysupport (which is being deprecated) to
    dh_python2. Drop python-support build dependency.
    (Closes: #614764)
  * debian/rules: Install a library search path for a pysupport compatible
    gtk-2.0 directory, to avoid instantly breaking all reverse dependencies.
    This needs to stay until they get converted to dh_python2.
  * Fix test suite calls during package build (Closes: #619257):
    - debian/rules: Copy Python files from our modules into build tree, so
      that the tests actually find them. In Python you can't have Python
      modules and compiled extensions which belong to the same import in
      different directories. (Unfortunately it's hard to upstream this, so
      keep it as a Debian specific hack for now.)
    - debian/rules: Run the tests under xvfb so that the Gdk/Gtk ones can
      succeed.
    - debian/rules: Disable fakeroot for the tests by unsetting $LD_PRELOAD.
      Otherwise the tests try to connect to root's session D-BUS.
    - debian/control.in: Add build dependencies: xvfb (as we now use it in
      debian/rules), dbus-x11 (as the test suite uses dbus-launch), and
      python-apt-dbg/python-cairo-dbg, so that the test cases for the debug
      builds have all dependencies met.

pygobject (2.14.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revert last upload, the pygobject patch was fine and the bug lies in
    pygtk. Furthermore, wakeupfd gets used anyway since Python supports
    it, so we *need* this patch.
